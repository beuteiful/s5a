#Coding Exercise
##Abstract

The exercise is broken in 3 parts, as described below. When you are done, follow these steps to delivery your answers.

* Create a new repository in Github, and upload your entire project, with the code you wrote, into Github
* Send us the URL to the repository
* Note, we should be able to clone your repo and compile all code in the project you created.

##Exercises

1) Write Unit tests, using any test framework, for the Java class below
```Java

package com.s5a.interview;

public class Product {

	private String brandName;

	public Product(String brandName) {
		this.brandName = brandName;
	}

	public String getBrandName() {
		return brandName;
	}

}

```

2) Write one Service class that provides integration to the DAO layer UserDAO class, according to the **resources** section at very bottom of this page. Write unit tests that you think are needed to make sure the Service class is bug free

3) Perform a code review and write your recommendations to the code below.
Note, there are lots of missing parts and we expect you call out them. +1 (as bonus) if you refactor the code, in a new class, and make the compilation passes.

```java

package com.s5a.interview;

public class ProductController {

	Product product = ServiceProduct.add("Saks-brand-name");

	private String showProduct() {
		product.getBrandName()
	}

	public boolean addProduct(String brandName) {
		product = serviceProduct.add(brandName);

		return true;
	}

	public static void formatedBrandName() {
		System.out.println("Current product: " + product.getBrandName)
	}

}

```
